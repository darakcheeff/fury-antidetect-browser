/** Who did what, and when.
 *
 *  The table has been written to since the first migration and until now there
 *  was nowhere to read it, which made it a table rather than an audit. For the
 *  agencies this product is for, "who opened that profile on Tuesday" is the
 *  question asked after somebody leaves, and it is the reason a team pays for
 *  anything.
 *
 *  Owners and admins only, and the server is what decides that — this screen
 *  shows what it is given. A member seeing every action of every colleague is
 *  surveillance rather than accountability.
 *
 *  Paged by id rather than by page number. Rows arrive while somebody is
 *  reading, and OFFSET would show them one twice or skip it. */
