//! Fetching a `.crx` from the Chrome Web Store by id, the way the browser
//! itself would — and from where the browser would.
//!
//! The update endpoint hands out the current package for any id. What matters
//! here is not the URL but the route: the download goes **through the proxy
//! of the profile it is being installed into**, so Google sees the exit that
//! profile always shows it, and never the operator's own address beside an
//! extension id that says what the operator is up to. That was the objection
//! in `install_core.rs` to fetching anything automatically, and the decision
//! recorded in docs/12 (B, 12.09.2026) is this compromise: fetch, but only
//! along the profile's own path. A profile with no proxy fetches directly,
//! because directly *is* its path.
//!
//! What comes back is checked, not trusted: `ext::parse` recovers the signing
//! key and derives the id from it, and the caller refuses a package whose key
//! does not derive the id that was asked for. The endpoint is Google's, over
//! TLS, but the check costs nothing and is what "installed by id" means.
